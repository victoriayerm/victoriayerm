## *Hello everyone!* :dizzy:
My name is *Victoria*, I am from **_Ukraine_**, living in **_Belgium_** since 2016.
Currently I am working as a procurement specialist, but I would like to change my profession. I am super excited to be a student at **_HackYourFutureBelgium_** program.

Things I love:
* :muscle: traveling, hiking, biking 
* :dancer: sports and especially dancing
* :book: books
* :ok_woman: hanging out with my friends, parties
* :ghost: comedies
* :tada: theatres
* :heart: learn something new

We can connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)

See you all soon!

Thanks for reading it! :laughing:
